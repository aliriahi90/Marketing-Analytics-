# Cutomer data Analysis
In this project first I wanted to know more about our customers and see what types of customers we have regarding their purchase history from our brand, in order to make our different customers’ demographic and historical profile. Then we analyzed our different customers’ demographic features and the relationships between these features and their purchase history. The next step was to explore the whole market to find customers that we can attract them in order to get the larger market share. The final step was to deal with a totally new customer without any purchase history. So we tried to find an algorithm to predict the shopping behavior of a totally new customer according to its demographic features in order to help company to make better decisions with new customers. And of course at the end we will have some recommendations for the company that we inferred from our analysis results.
